# Flooded Fields
My  goal is to build a real-time modeling system that can estimates the numbers of acres flooded out on a per crop basis each year across the Midwest, particularly croplnads affected by extreme flooding in 2019. I plan to do this by identifying flooded areas in a landscape classification for 2019 and comparing those areas to a classification for 2017. By doing so, I hope to understand  both this specific event, and more general influences on agriculture in the region.
